"Lightweight Middleware System Design for NLP-Driven API Routing and External Data Aggregation"

Why this qualifies:
Lightweight: It's built on FastAPI (fast, async, minimal dependencies).

Middleware: Acts as an intermediary — processes input, routes intelligently, talks to external systems.

Well-defined responsibilities: Clear separation of concerns (controller, NLP/fuzzy logic, routing, data aggregation).

Extensible: Can easily be expanded for logging, retries, multiple endpoint queries, etc.


Logging

Retries using httpx + tenacity

Support for multiple endpoints (fan-out calls)

Structured response aggregation

Error handling and extensibility points

# Fuzzy Gherkin Step Resolver (FastAPI)

## Features

- Translates Gherkin steps to API endpoints using fuzzy logic.
- Fetches responses from matched API.
- Async + retries + logging.
- Extensible microservice architecture.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
